## ‚ùì What is this?

Runtime Options Manager is supposed to be a drop-in solution for managing runtime settings for your game. Settings like
resolution, audio volumes, graphics, etc. It's all based around scriptable objects to easily manage your settings in the
editor.

## üî® Quick Start

1. Install the package either using a git link or OpenUPM. See installation section for instructions.
2. Open up your project settings inside Unity and create a new settings manager.
3. Create a setting in your project by right clicking - Create - Hertzole - Settings - the setting of your choice
4. Create a category in your settings manager and assign the settings.
5. Build your UI. I'd recommend importing the uGUI sample to see how you can create a simple UI for your settings.
